  Copies a password to a buffer, but will only copy the maximum
  characters. Always places a NULL terminator at the end of the
  output string.

  NOTE: Buffer MUST be at least PW_MAX_LENGTH + 1 in length.

  @param[in]  BufferLength  Length of the output buffer (in CHAR16s).
  @param[in]  Password      Pointer to the password to be copied.

  @retval     EFI_SUCCESS           String copied.
  @retval     EFI_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL  Buffer cannot hold a max-length password.

  Public interface for validating password strings.

  @retval     TRUE      Password is valid. "Failures" should be 0.
